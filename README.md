# FaceDetectWebcam

This allows face detection with computer webcam (desktop or laptop). Developed using Python 3.6 and OpenCV 4.0. This program detects faces in real-time video.

This project uses the Viola-Jones Object Detection Framework with Haar Cascade Classifiers. The algorithm only detects faces, and does not perform recognition of any sort. 

The project consists of 3 files:

1. facedetect_web.py - File containing the Python source code.
2. haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml - The Haar Cascade Classifier file.
3. sample_facedetect.jpg - A sample screenshot of how face detection works.
