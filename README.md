# FaceDetectWebcam

This allows face detection with computer webcam (desktop or laptop). Developed using Python 3.6 and OpenCV 4.0. This program detects faces in real-time video.

This project uses the Viola-Jones Object Detection Framework with Haar Cascade Classifiers. The algorithm only detects faces, and does not perform recognition of any sort.
